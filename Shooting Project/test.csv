In the vicinity of 1106 S. 1st Avenue, Officer A attempted to avoid a collision with four year-old Subject 3, who ran across the street from east to west. Officer A intentionally laid his motorcycle down after which the motorcycle skidded approximately thirty feet on its left side before striking Subject 3 and her adult cousin Subject 2. When Officer A, who was injured in the accident, attempted to render aid to Subject 3 he was confronted by her father, Subject 1. Subject 1 physically attacked Officer A and threw him repeatedly to the ground. The evidence also suggests that Subject 1’s cousin also participated in the attack on Officer A. Officer A announced his office and attempted to defend himself from the attack. However, at some point, Officer A started to fear for his life. Officer A then removed his firearm from its holster on the right side of his body and discharged one round, striking Subject 1 to the left side of his groin area. Subject 1, Subject 3, Subject 2, and Officer A were each transported by ambulances to Loyola Hospital. Subject 1 died from the gunshot wound.","Chicago","Off-duty; Christopher Middleton"

A check of the provided vehicle registration revealed that the vehicle had been stolen the previous day. The officer confirmed the stolen status over the radio with the dispatcher. The officer parked his marked police vehicle about twenty yards away from the stolen vehicle and waited on additional officers to arrive. The suspect exited the stolen vehicle resulting in the officer displaying his service weapon and commanding the suspect to get on the ground. The suspect fled the scene causing the officer to give chase on foot. The officer was able to grab him and a struggle ensued. A second uniformed officer arrived on scene, and expeditiously exited his unmarked police vehicle to assist the first officer with the suspect. The second officer deployed his electronic control weapon, but it had no effect. The officers continued to struggle with the suspect trying to place him in handcuffs. The suspect punched the first officer in the face, allowing him to free himself from the officers’ grasp. The first officer then deployed oleoresin capsicum spray on the suspect to try to prevent his escape, but that had little effect. The suspect was able to enter the second officer’s unmarked police vehicle, which had been left running, and drive it away. A short time later, he returned to the scene, exited the stolen police vehicle and entered the original stolen vehicle. The second officer drew his service weapon and gave the verbal commands, “Police, don’t move,” but the suspect failed to comply and drove away. The second officer called a vehicle pursuit and additional uniformed officers, in marked police vehicles joined the pursuit. An uninvolved uniformed officer was marked out on a traffic stop at the 2800 block of Graham Road. Realizing the pursuit was likely to pass his location, the officer deployed Stop Sticks in an effort to end the pursuit and took a position of cover. The suspect slowed down and veered to the left to avoid the Stop Sticks. The officer removed himself from his position of cover and changed the location of the Stop Sticks to attempt to disable the suspect’s vehicle. The driver again changed his direction of travel, made a sharp turn toward the officer and accelerated toward him. The officer, now without cover, drew his service weapon, pointed it at the suspect and commanded, “Stop, police.” The driver continued in the officer’s direction and the officer discharged his service weapon at the approaching vehicle, striking the driver. The driver changed his direction of travel again and the pursuit continued. The suspect eventually side-swiped a police vehicle that tried to stop him and the pursuit concluded when another officer successfully utilized the Precision Immobilization Technique to disable the vehicle. The suspect was taken into custody after a brief struggle. The officers rendered aid until relieved by Fire and Rescue personnel.","FairfaxCounty",NA

The couple had been slowly breaking up, Harrington said, and on the morning of the shooting she told Geer she had signed a lease on an apartment. Geer began drinking, court records show, and by early afternoon he began tossing furniture and other belongings of Harrington’s onto the front yard. The couple’s daughters called Harrington, who came home from work and tried to calm Geer down. Instead, she said, when she followed him inside, he tossed an empty suitcase down the stairs and hit her in the head, so she called 911 and reported, “he’s just throwing everything out of the house of mine.” She also reported that Geer owned shotguns and handguns, but they were locked up. Geer stood behind his screen door with his hands spread on top of it. Barnes told investigators he was trying to convince Geer to come outside, and that Geer was unnerved by Torres silently pointing his gun at Geer’s chest. Barnes said at one point he told Torres to lower his weapon, but when Geer moved one hand to scratch his nose, Torres returned his aim to center mass. Then at 3:34 p.m., while Geer and Barnes were still talking, Torres suddenly shot once into Geer’s chest from a distance of 17 feet.

On Sunday October 10, 2010 at 11:25pm squads for the Fugitive Apprehension Unit went to N93 W25866 Riverview Ln Lisbon, Wi to look for Jeremy Spence who was wanted on warrant #J45666 for fleeing MPD IR# 10-269-0176. Upon arrival the officers observed Mr. Spence in the residence along with his mother. Officers contacted their sergeant who advised them to call for the Waukesha County Sheriff Department to help out. While waiting for the deputies to arrive the officers observed the mother going back and forth from a room just off of the front door area. When the Sheriff Deputies arrived they indicated they knew who Mr. Spence was, and that he has an extensive record including resisting and fleeing. Officers made contact with the mother and asked for permission to search the house. which she eventually granted. As officers entered the house they went to the room and found it to be a laundry room that led to the garage. As the officers entered the garage led by P.O. [redacted] Mr. Spence started the vehicle. P.O. [redacted] drew his issued weapon and ordered Mr. Spence to shut the vehicle off. WCSD made forced entry to the garage via the side service door but were unable to enter due to the amount of property blocking access. [redacted] attempted to get around the rear of the auto to gain an advantage on the driver but every time he tried Mr. Spence would put the car in reverse and back up. After approximately three attempts of getting to the driver side Mr. Spence floored the accelerator and placed the car in drive. The auto sped forward crashing through the overhead garage door and [redacted] fearing for [redacted]'s life and the deputies that were on containment on the other side of the door, P.O. [redacted] discharged his issued service weapon three times at 12:23am on October 11, 2010. The auto was struck two times in the trunk lid and Mr. Spence was struck in the head by the gunfire. The auto continued forward approximately 20 feet before crashing into an unoccupied pick-up truck that was parked on the drive pushing it over the curb line, Mr. Spence was taken into custody and transported to Froedtert Hospital for a GSW to the head by Waukesha County Sheriff and a Waukesha County Med Unit. Waukesha County Sheriff is the lead investigating agency and it will be reviewed by the Waukesha County District Attorney's Office.I spoke with P.O. [redacted] who gave the followinq statement. On October 10, 2010 he was checkinp for a fleeing suspect from Milwaukee (Jeremy Spence) in the Town of Lisbon along with P.O. [redacted], P.O. [redacted] and P.O. [redacted] and the Waukesha County Sheriff Office. P.O. [redacted] states he entered the residence with P.O. [redacted] following him. They located Mr. Spence sitting in the driver seat of a red auto in the attached garage with the overhead garage door closed. Mr. Spence started the vehicle and P.O. [redacted] states he drew his issued handgun and began giving commands for Mr. Spence to shut off the vehicle, which was running and show his hands, which he refused. During the commands Mr. Spence maintained eye contact with him (P.O. [redacted], P.O. [redacted] attempted to make his way behind the auto to gain access to the driver side where Mr. Spence was located to take him into custody. Every time P.O. [redacted] moved behind the auto, Mr. Spence would place the auto in reverse and begin to back up attempting to hit the offir.er and, blocking the route. P.O. [redated] states Mr. Spence began revving the engine and placed it in drive racing towards the closed overhead door. P.O. [redacted] fearing for the officers and deputies on the outside of the garage discharged his service weapon through the rear window of the auto prior to the auto crashing through the overhead door. The auto continued under the collapsed door and crashed into a parked pickup truck that was on the driveway. The auto continued to run as if the accelerator was pressed to the floor until Mr. Spence was removed from the auto and taken into custody.l spoke with P.O. [redacted] who states that he did not witness the use of force but during the incident he was holding containment of the house in front of the overhead garage door along with two Waukesha County Sheriff Deputies. When he heard the auto start up and the engine racing he positioned himself behind another auto that was parked on the drive with one of the deputies while the other placed Stop Sticks at the end of the drive. P.O. [redacted] then observed the auto crash through the overhead garage door and impact the pick-up truck on the other side of the driveway.I spoke with P.O. [redacted] who states that he was following P.O. [redacted] into the garage to check for Mr. Spence when he heard a vehicle start up. P.O. [redacted] immediately began giving commands to Mr. Spence who was seated in the drivers seat and revving the engine of the auto. P.O. [redacted] states he tried several times to get to the other side of the auto but when he tried Mr. Spence would place the car in reverse and back up blocking his access. The engine continued rewing and he heard the tires squeal and the auto began forward towards the closed overhead door. At this time P.O. [redacted] heard 2-3 gunshots from P.O. [redacted] and the auto traveled through the door. P.O. [redacted] ran back into the house and out the front door where he observed the auto crashed into a parked pickup truk on the driveway of the residence.","Milwaukee","3 shots fired; 1 hit (to the head); victim in car"

1127050,NA,1,"N","B","M","U",NA,"9.0",2,"W;W","F;M","Milwaukee Police Department","On Wednesday 4-28-10 at approx. 6:35PM, District Two Police Officers [redacted] and [redacted], while responding to a call for service, discharged their service weapons at a suspect, Eddie L. Jones, causing his death. This incident was thoroughly investigated by both the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the District Attorney's office, and what follows is a summary of the investigation and ifs findings. It is not exhaustive of a!I details, and for a complete understanding of all aspects of the investigation, please refer to Milwaukee Police incident reports filed under 1R1011B0178.Both officers were interviewed on the night of the incident by ClB detectives, as well as District Attorney John Chisolm and personnel from his staff. Both officers gave statements that were consistent with one another, witness accounts and the physical evidence, and their statements are summarized as follows:On Wednesday 4-28-10, POs [redaced] and [redacted] were assigned as partners on Squad [redacted] early shift uniformed squad, with [redacted] driving. Between the beginning of their shift at 3:00PM and approx. 6:31PM, they responded to and handled several routine calls for service. At 6:31PM, they were dispatched to an assignment of ""Battery- Cutting"" at 1539 S. 9th St., with the information that a man was chasing a woman and was armed with a knife.PO [redacted] statement indicated that upon their arrival at this assignment, he observed numerous people who were in the street and on the sidewalks, and that several of them waved down the squad. He asked the citizens where the subject with the knife was, and they pointed towards a house that was just northeast of where the squad was parked. PO [redacted] and his partner then got out of the squad and walked in that direction. As they did so, he observed a heavyset black male sitting on the front steps of a porch, and he also observed that the male was holding another person, a black female, across his lap as one would hold a child. He could see that the female was bleeding from her face, and was agitated. At the same time, he saw that the male was holding a large butcher knife ln his right hand, and so he drew his service weapon (Smith and Wesson M&P .40 caliber handgun) and ordered the suspect to drop the knife by yelling this command several times.The suspect did not comply with his commands, and responded verbally to the officer's commands with words to the effect of ""back up."" The suspect then raised the knife in hls right hand, and PO [redacted] believed at that time that he was going to stab the female with the knife. The female was still laying across his lap, and the suspect's upper chest and head were isolated. He estimated his distance from the suspect as 10-15 feet. PO [redacted] then took aim at the suspect, and fired his weapon at him. He could not recall how many shots he fired (later examination of his weapon revealed that he fired seven rounds.) He a!so stated that his partner was standing to his right, and believes that she also fired at the suspect.PO [redacted] observed the suspect slump backwards after being shot, and the female immediately got up from his lap. He went to the female and checked on her condition. He notified his dispatcher via KSA radio that they had fired shots, and requested medical attention for the suspect. A Milwaukee Fire Dept. unit had been staged up the block, and they immediately responded to the scene and began tending to the suspect. Because of the immediate response of MFD personnel, he did not attempt any life saving measures on the suspect.Numerous other District Two squads responded to the scene very rapidly. The other responding squads began to take control of the scene, and PO [redacted] was escorted to a squad by other responding officers, where he remained until the arrival of CIB personnel. At no time did he talk to PO [redacted] prior to being interviewed.PO [redacted] was likewise interviewed by ClB personnel and DA Chisolm and his staff. She made a statement that was very consistent with that of PO [redacted]. She related that they were dispatched to the battery cutting assignment. As they were responding to the scene, she (as the officer not driving) was reading the CAD updates out loud, so that they both knew what they were responding to. When they arrived in the 1500 block of S. 9th St., she observed numerous people running around in the street in a chaotic scene. The squad came to a stop and she immediately exited and drew her service weapon, due to the nature of the assignment.There were several people pointing and yelling ""over there"" indicating in a northeast direction. She observed a black male subject holding a black female subject on his lap. She could see that the male was holding a large knife in his right hand, and was making motions as though he was stabbing the female. PO [redacted] was approx. 20-30 feet from the suspect at this time, and she pointed her weapon at the suspect and continued walking towards him. As she was doing so, she yelled at the suspect several times to drop the knife, but he ignored her commands. She also recalled that her partner was standing to her left.At some point she observed that the female was bleeding, and she feared that the suspect was going to stab her with the knife. The female's position was low enough on his body that she had a clear target of his chest and head. She took aim and fired two or three rounds at the suspect (examination of her weapon revealed that she fired two rounds.) She saw the suspect fall backwards and drop the knife, and the female got up and ran away. She approached the suspect and kicked the knife away from him. She also got on the radio and called for medical assistance for the suspect, as she could see he had been shot. She put on latex gloves in preparation for pertorming medical attention on the suspect, however a MFD engine pulled up almost immediately and began attending to the suspect. Other MPD squads also quickly arrived on the scene, and she was escorted to Sgt. [redacted] squad, where she remained until the arrival of CIB personnel. She did not interact with PO [redacted] during this time.CIB detectives subsequently interviewed the female subject of this incident, [redacted]. Her interview revealed that she and the suspect Eddie Jones had been previously engaged in a relationship, however they had split up due to his violent nature. He had been arrested recently for a domestic violence incident against her, and that she had obtained a restraining order against him. Over the past couple of days, Jones called her numerous times, telling her to drop the restraining order, and threatening to kil! her and her new boyfriend if she did not. She did report these threats to the police.On this date at approx. 6:00PM, she returned to her house, and upon walking towards her house, she saw Jones approach her and someone yelled for her to run and that Jones had a knife. She ran away, but Jones caught up to her and the two struggled. He pushed her to the ground and held the knife to her throat, while making verbal threats to kill her. As this was going on, she saw the police arrive at the scene, and the officers subsequently shot Jones.lt should be noted that [redacted] was highly intoxicated and equally agitated at the time she was interviewed, and while she did not provide a great level of detail, what she did tell was consistent with the officers' statements, other witness statements and the physical evidence.Another citizen eyewitness to the incident [redacted] was interviewed as part of this investigation. [redacted] lives across the street from the scene, and he observed the incident from his front porch and yard area. Additionally, he recorded the incident on his camera phone, which he voluntarily turned over to detectives in order to extract the video. The video is of surprisingly good quality, and shows the events that occurred prior to police arrival, as well as the arrival the squad on the scene. It clearly shows the squad pull up to the scene, shows the two officers exit the squad, approach the suspect with their guns drawn, and order the suspect to drop the knife. It shows the officers fire several shots at the suspect, but as soon as the shots are heard, the camera operator moves the camera away from the scene, as though he were startled by the shots. He regains his composure and continues filming the aftermath of the shooting, including the arrival of MFD and additional squads on the scene.The actions of both officers was clearly captured on the video, and it is consistent in all ways with both of their accounts. This video is in the possession of MPD should it be needed for review or training purposes.Numerous other citizen witnesses were interviewed, and all provided substantially similar versions of events.Subsequent to their statements on the night of the incident, all standard protocols for an officer-involved shooting were complied with, including collecting the officers' weapons, issuing new weapons to them, placing them on administrative duty, and conveying them for drug testing.On 4-29-10, Dr. Rogalska of the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's office conducted an autopsy on the suspect Jones. The cause of death was deermined to be from numerous gunshot wounds, and the manner of death ruled a homicide. A total of 10 gunshot wounds (entrance and exit) wounds were noted to the suspect's head, neck and chest. A total of seven bullets, as well as several small bullet fragments were recovered from Jones' body during the autopsy.On Tuesday 5-4-10, this incident was formally reviewed by DA Chisolm for the purposes of determining the legality of the officers' actions. DA Chisolm indicated that it was his legal opinion that both officers acted properly and within the guidelines of the !aw when they used deadly force to stop the life-threatening actions of the suspect Eddie Jones.","Milwaukee","7 shots fired from one PO, 2 shots from other PO; number of hits unknown — 10 gunshot wounds (entrances and exits), 7 bullets in victim's body; knife"

Witnesses had seen the man acting erratically and pointing the firearm at passerby. Once at the location, the officer, who was on solo patrol, encountered a white male subject carrying a silver firearm. With his firearm drawn, the officer shouted “Police! Don’t move!” but the subject turned his back to the officer. As the officer radioed that he had the subject stopped, the subject abruptly spun and pointed his firearm directly at the officer while cursing him. The officer fired three rounds, striking the subject three times, and causing his demise. Subsequently, the subject’s firearm was determined to be an imitation pistol that had been painted silver and black. The subject had an arrest history for criminal mischief and false personation. At the time of the incident, the subject’s blood alcohol content was three and a half times the legal limit for driving and he had phencyclidine (PCP) in his system, as well as anti‐anxiety drugs and other substances consistent with reports that he had stolen and then consumed significant quantities of cough suppressant.","New York","IMITATION"

Two officers were injured during this incident, and three bystanders were struck and injured, as well. The event was precipitated by a fight between the two subjects, during which the first subject produced a firearm and possibly fired on the second subject. Police heard gunfire and responded: one uniformed officer approached from the south as an unmarked vehicle with one plainclothes sergeant and two plainclothes officers approached from the north. At some point, the second subject achieved control of the firearm, and possibly fired on the first subject. He also discharged a round at the lone uni‐ formed officer, who had now closed to within several feet. The uniformed officer returned fire, while the plainclothes officers at the opposite end of the block also began to shoot. Of the two rounds fired by the uniformed officer, one struck one of the two plainclothes officers in the chest—the officer was saved from this crossfire by his bullet‐resistant vest. The plain‐ clothes sergeant discharged 16 rounds, and the two plainclothes officers discharged 16 rounds and 12 rounds, respectively. During the gunfire, a fifth officer, who did not fire, was struck in the wrist and injured, and the three previously mentioned civilian bystanders were also struck. Of the criminal participants, the first subject was struck six times and succumbed to his inju‐ ries, and the second subject was struck 23 times, but survived. (A grand jury refused to indict the second subject for firing on the uniformed officer.) The deceased subject had 13 prior ar‐ rests, including robbery, burglary, and resisting arrest. The deceased subject’s blood‐alcohol content was twice the legal limit for driving at the time of his demise.","New York","FIREARM"

When the detective attempted to effect an arrest, the subject resisted violently. The fight spilled from the vestibule where the transaction had occurred into the street, at which point a male Hispanic neighbor attempted to intercede on the drug dealer’s behalf. This second subject choked the detective, nearly causing him to lose consciousness. In fear for his life, the detective fired a single round, striking the second subject and causing his demise. The first subject fled but was subsequently apprehended. The second subject had prior arrests associated with narcotics.

The police internal investigation concluded in November that the officers were justified. But the conflicting reports prompted Dotson to make the rare move of requesting an FBI review. No civilian witnesses reported seeing Ball aim a gun at police; at least one said Ball was tossing the weapon away when he was shot. Officers Jason Chambers and Timothy Boyce said in police reports they saw Ball clutch his waistband as he ran. One said he saw Ball pull the weapon and point it at them, the other said he saw the gun in Ball’s right hand when he turned toward them.
