# Data-Science-Projects

## Projects from 2018-2020

- Law Networks: Analyzing different law datasets using ERGMs and triad census to determine how the interaction between gender and seniority affects the formation of social groups among employees in friendship, advice, and coworker networks.

- Sex Differences: Designing and evaluating several different statistical models to predict the professional success of graduate students. Factors such as kids and marriage are examined to analyze how they affect professional success differently across genders.

- Bayesian Statistics: Applying Bayesian analysis and inference on the previous sex differences data in order to produce a Bayesian model.

- Time Series Analysis: Using time series analysis to create a predictive model in order to forecast the changes in sea level of San Francisco in the next two years.


## Projects from 2014-2018

- Wine Prediction: Creating a model to predict the quality of a certain wine given characteristics such as residual sugar, alcohol level, color, pH, and several more.

- Simulated Islanders: Designing and conducting an experiment using a virtual simulations to determine if certain music genres, and its interaction with age, have any effect on blood pressure.

- Fatal Police Shooting: Designing and evaluating several different statistical models to predict fatal police encounters using predictors such as race, gender, weapon, and nature of encounter.
